    <h2>DistanceCS CodeSystem</h2>

    <p>Measurement needs to be done to calculate the distance between two reference point or a lesion location
        (mass) to a reference point on the troubled body organ with the aim of deriving an accurate position of the
        mass on the organ to facilitate the appropriate treatment should be done, while also aiming at
        analyzing changes in the organ's dynamic morphology before, after, and during the treatment to maintains
        normal stable position of the organs.</p>

        <p align="center"><i>Pic 1. Linear-Distance and Through-skin between two referencence point Measurement of
                Breast</i></p>
        <p>The horizontal red lines indicate the level of the sternal notch (胸骨), the upper margin of nipple base,
            medial margin of the nipple, the lower margin of nipple base and the inframammary fold (乳房下皱襞). The vertical
            lines indicate the anterior midline (前正中線) and the middle line of the nipple.
            The point on the pic 3 above describe as the intersection of the horizontal and vertical red lines and be
            known as:
        </p>
        <p>
            &#9826 A = sternal notch;<br>
            &#9826 A’ = the upper margin of the nipple base;<br>
            &#9826 B = anterior midline;<br>
            &#9826 B’ = nipple;<br>
            &#9826 C’ = the lower margin of the nipple base;<br>
            &#9826 C = the lowest point of the inframammary fold;<br>
            &#9826 D = the intersection of the anterior midline and the lowest level of the inframammary fold;<br>
        </p>
        <p>Thus, the black line is represented as distance measurement between points, as described below:</p>
        <p>
            &#9826 AA’ = the distance between sternal notch to the upper margin of the nipple base;<br>
            &#9826 BB’ = the distance between anterior midline to the nipple;<br>
            &#9826 CC’ = the distance between the lower margin of the nipple base to the lowest point of the
            inframammary fold;<br>
            &#9826 AD = the distance between the sternal notch to the lowest point of the inframammary fold;<br>
        </p>
        <p>Under well defined of breast location code system and knowledge of morphological location points in
            the breast, it is sustain the distance code system can be formed as bellow.</p>
